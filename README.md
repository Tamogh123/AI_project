# INTRODUCTION
Theft has always been a serious worry in society, resulting in enormous property loss
and a sense of insecurity. To address this issue, numerous measures have been
implemented, including the hiring of security professionals, the installation of
surveillance cameras, and the installation of alarms. These measures, however, have
limits and might sometimes fail to prevent theft.
To address this issue, we have developed a theft detection system using various
algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and
Dijkstra's Algorithm. These algorithms have been widely used in the field of
computer-sciences and have proven to be effective in solving many real-world
problems.
Our system aims to detect theft by analyzing the movements of an object or person in a
given area. The algorithms used in this project will help us detect any suspicious
behavior or movement and alert us in real-time, thus preventing theft. In this project,
we've imagined the perpetrator as a spot or a dot in the matrix and any valuable object
prone to theft as another dot in the matrix. The burglars path to the object that must be
protected can be predicted based on the obstacles present in the path using multiple
algorithms ( bfs,dijkstra, and a* etc). We observe and contrast his actions with those of
other algorithms to determine which algorithm gives us the best outcome
